# StringTastic

StringTastic is a simple program to do the following tasks:
- Import a list of files names by selecting them in a file selection dialog (right click on either rich text box)
- Import a list of folder names by selecting them in a folder selection dialog (right click on either rich text box)
- Compare a bunch of strings
- Perform sort and trim operations on strings


I normally use this program when
- I'm building documentation and don't want to get file or folder names by hand.
- I want to compare a list of strings and I don't want to put them into two files and use [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/) to compare them.
